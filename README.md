“Pizza Bill Generator App | Core Java and OOP Project” highlights, in a practical way, how a simple application with core Java can be set up using the very basics of OOP. The project will deal with a pizza billing system wherein users can choose various types of pizzas, like normal or deluxe, and add optional extras such as toppings, extra cheese, or packaging for takeaways. A program will calculate and generate the final bill, depending on the selection made.

The major aim of the project is to make the Java learner conceptualize and then apply core OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction in real-life scenarios. Since the development of this application is purely based on Core Java, it is perfect for beginners or intermediate programmers who want to enhance their Java basics by practically coding. This video will walk through the logic and structure of the code step by step and explain how different classes interact to produce the final output of the code.

This project is quite useful for students and developers who want to include a Java mini-project in their portfolio or for those preparing for viva or practical exams. It serves as a very good example of how to design and implement small, functional programs while keeping codes clean, modular, and object-oriented. The "Pizza Bill Generator App" video provides a clear, educative, and easy-to-follow guide for anyone who wants to enhance his or her understanding of Java programming and OOP design principles.
